If \u03bc = 0, the ladder cannot remain in equilibrium at any angle.  \n\n7. **Final Inequality:**  \n   - The minimum angle \\( \\theta \\) required so that the ladder does not slip is given by:  \n     \\[ \\theta \\geq \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\right) \\]  \n   - Additionally, ensure that 0 < \u03b8 < 90 degrees for physical relevance.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe mathematical inequality for the minimum angle required for the ladder not to slip is \\( \\theta \\geq \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\right) \\), with the condition that \u03bc > 0 and 0 < \u03b8 < 90 degrees.",
